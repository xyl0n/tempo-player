 It was released on 28 January 2008, as stated in Kerrang! The band stated that this album would be considerably heavier than their previous album. Scream Aim Fire has fewer screaming vocals than its predecessor, partly because of the problem lead singer Matthew Tuck had with his tonsils.

Additionally, the album hit number 4 on the Billboard 200, with first week sales of about 53,000. Since its release, Scream Aim Fire has sold over one million copies worldwide and over 300,000 copies in the US.
 
 The title track &quot;Scream Aim Fire&quot; is featured in the video game Guitar Hero World Tour.

The track &quot;Hearts Burst into Fire&quot; is featured in the video game NHL 09.
 
 Recording of the album was complete in November 2007 with vocalist/guitarist Matthew Tuck telling Kerrang! magazine he was looking forward to be working with guest producer Alec Cartio again.
 
 At midnight on the 28 January, Bullet for My Valentine were present in Cardiff to do an album signing to go with the release of the album. At 18:00 the same day, they did a 20 minute performance at HMV in Oxford Circus with 300 present to get their album signed.
 
 A 15-minute album commentary was released on the US digital single for &quot;Scream Aim Fire&quot;, released on 18 December 2007, along with the track &quot;Eye of the Storm&quot;, which was also released on a free Kerrang! CD and as a free download for signing up to the Sony BMG mailing list.
 
 The second single from the album, &quot;Hearts Burst into Fire&quot;, was announced by the band during their UK tour. Matt Tuck said that the band recorded the song live for the music video.
 
 &quot;Waking the Demon&quot; is the third single of the album.
